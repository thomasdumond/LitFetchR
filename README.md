<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of LitFetchR is to automatically retrieve and deduplicate
reference metadata based on saved search strings. Access to Web of
Science and Scopus requires personal API keys, while PubMed can be
queried without one.

## Installation

You can install the development version of LitFetchR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

    {r} install.packages("devtools") devtools::install_github("thomasdumond/LitFetchR")

## Tutorial

Please see the [written tutorial]() as well as the [youtube tutorial]().
